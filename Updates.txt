Feedback by market team:
- Everything looks good.
- Need to add tab/cloumn which gives percentage match when compared uploaded resume with job description.
- And in recruiter tab/ admin tab they said to add tab to store the data of the recruiter(who posts original jobs) like name, email, contact number and company name.

The things need to be updated:
- To add the drop down to the visa row in the job description to choose multiple types.
- Tech stack - comapre with consultant tech stack.
- the names like consultant and recruiter and admin are in caps need to be modified.
